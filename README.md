# QBUILD_Challenge
Everything should be in there, however I had some issues converting datas from the CSV into a SQL Database.
I Identified the SQL Express format to be the issue and I believe I could resolve my problems with another solution, however, I didn't have time to switch.It means that unfortunately, some of the data are misplaced due to the presence of quoted fields where there are still "," characters, which are the same as the field's separators.
Other than that, everything works as expected, and should be pretty straightforward to read.
